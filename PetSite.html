    <h1>Lord Fluffington's Blog</h1>
      <p>Hampered only by his lack of opposable thumbs, I, as servant present this blog.</p>
    <h2>Long live Master Fluff!</h2>
      <p>Here are some things that he requests from us inferior humans.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Rubsies. With both hands.</li>
      <li>No rubsies for dogs.</li>
      <li>If I like your rubsies you shall never stop.</li>
      <li>Kibbles.</li>
    </ul>
